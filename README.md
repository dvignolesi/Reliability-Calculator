# Reliability-Calculator

This program is developed on the C++ Qt framework and is intended to be an easy to use, drag-and-drop interface reliability software. This software will accept user inputs as they create nodes for an abstract representation of a system, complete with serial and paralell node connections. Once the node map is created, the user can enter the individual reliability numbers for each node and then have the program calculate the reliability for the system as whole along with the specific formula used to perform that calculation.
